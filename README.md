# Travel-Log
Keep track of where you have traveled before

This is a personal project that was based off of Coding Gardens travel log idea and expanded upon further. Check it out at https://github.com/CodingGarden/travel-log.

This will continue to be a work in progress and any suggestions are appreciated! Just pull the code and set up your environment variables based off in a .env file using the examples in the same directory for both the client and server.

# Running the program
Install all packages using "npm install". Run the server using "npm run dev" and the client using "npm start".

# How to use it
A map will be displayed on the page when everything loads up. Double clicking the map will allow you to enter information on a location you have been and uplaod some images. You can then click on the markers later on to view this information again.
